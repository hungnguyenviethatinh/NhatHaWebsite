## Introduction

This a project that I got the deal from an electric equipment supply and construction company owner.

He wanna build a website to broadcast his company as a reputable electric equipment supplier, construction and maintenance services.

This website would introduce all about his company information, their history, missions and values, services and projects. Especially, their customers could browser their products with images, details, functions and installation guides. The website could be displayed in two languages Vietnamese and English.

This was a static website. My partner and I decided to build it with [Angular v8](https://angular.io/).

This project lasted in two week, started from mid September 2019 to December 2019. After that, I was still in charge of enhancing new features and maintaining this website until May 2020.
